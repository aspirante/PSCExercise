# Platform Science Code Exercise - Hungarian algoritm

This app. shows a Drivers list and a Shipments(Address) list.

The data is fetched from a JSON file stored in the assets folder and is read to obtain the information. every time you start the app. to fill in the two lists (drivers, addresses).
and once the lists are filled only have interaction with the driver list. In this list when an item is selected, automatically assigned an address(shipment), and at the same time,
the address will be marked in the list with red color to indicate not available.
